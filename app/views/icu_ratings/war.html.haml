          The original method, devised in 2005, was a 3-year average, weighted towards
          more recent years and slightly favouring ICU over FIDE ratings. See

          for more details.

          The 2011 AGM voted in favour of the simplest scheme possible which just averages the
          latest ICU and FIDE ratings with equal weighting. This comes into effect on March 12 2012.
    %dt It's January and the latest FIDE ratings are out so why aren't they being used?
    %dd
      The calculation averages paired ICU and FIDE rating lists from the same year.
      If only one of the two lists is available for a particular year then it is not used.
      This generally only happens in early January because by the middle of the month both
      lists are usually out.
