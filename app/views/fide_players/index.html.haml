    %dl
      %dt Can I edit FIDE players?
      %dd
        For the most part, no. The FIDE player (and ratings) information in this application's
        database is kept synchronized with FIDE's by automated background jobs.
      %dt So is there anything at all I have control over here?
      %dd
        Yes: you can create, remove or change what ICU player any given FIDE player
        is associated with. However this only applies to FIDE players whose federation
        is Ireland. In particular, you should periodically look for players whose
        federation is IRL but which have no match yet and try to find one for them.
      %dt How do I do that?
      %dd
        %p
          Click on the question mark where the player's ICU ID would be if there was one.
          You will be presented with a search over ICU players already initialised with the player's FIDE
          name. This may or may not be showing any ICU matches (the same player can sometimes have different
          ICU and FIDE names) so you may need to make some adjustments before obtaining a match.
        %p
          Click the
          = icon_tag "link", "Link FIDE player to this ICU player"
          button if you've found an ICU player that matches.
        %p
          Click the
          = icon_tag "unlink", "Unlink FIDE player from this ICU player"
          button to disassociate an ICU player if you think it's incorrect.
      %dt Can I link an Irish FIDE player with any ICU player?
      %dd
        No, the system performs some checks to prevent incorrect matches. Check with the system
        administrator if you are unable to create an association which you think is correct.
      %dt Is it possible for an Irish FIDE player not to match any ICU player?
      %dd
        Yes. The FIDE database includes players who retired before the ICU database was established
        and so will not have a match. There are about 20 such players, for example, John Moles and
        Bernard Kernam. It would also be possible (though unlikely) for an Irish player to appear
        in the FIDE database without having played any games in Ireland. An expatriate for example.
