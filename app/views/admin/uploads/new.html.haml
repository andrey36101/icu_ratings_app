    %dd
      The types listed in the
      %em File format
      menu. Help on each supported format is available below - use the menu to show the help for each.
    %dt{class: "SwissPerfect"} Swiss Perfect
    %dd{class: "SwissPerfect"}
      = image_tag "help/swiss_perfect.png", align: "right", alt: "Example of Swiss Perfect files in a ZIP archive", class: "left-padded"
      %p
        Put all three Swiss Perfect files (INI, SCO and TRN) into
        an otherwise empty ZIP archive and upload that file.
        See the illustrative example on the right.
      %p
        Since Swiss Perfect has no way to specify the start and end dates of the tournament,
        please specify them in the inputs provided.
    %dt{class: "SPExport"} Swiss Perfect Export
    %dd{class: "SPExport"}
      = image_tag "help/spexport.png", align: "right", alt: "Part of file exported from Swiss Perfect", class: "left-padded"
      %p
        This type of file is produced by Swiss Perfect via
        %em File → Export View → As Text
        and can be uploaded as long as the options of
        %em tab separators,
        %em formatted output
        and
        %em include column headers
        are all selected when the file is saved.
      %p Since these files are missing the tournament name, start date and end date, please specify them in the upload form.
    %dt{class: "Krause"} FIDE (Krause)
    %dd{class: "Krause"}
      = image_tag "help/krause.png", align: "right", alt: "Part of a FIDE (Krause) formatted report", class: "left-padded"

        is used by FIDE for rating reports and was developed by Christian Krause, a FIDE arbiter.
      %p
        It can only represent ratings and IDs from one source, so please specify which using the menu provided.
        In practice, some applications that export this format have a tendancy to produce invalid federation codes
        and/or invalid round dates, so please also indicate what action should be taken in the event of any such issues.

      %p
        Only plain text files are supported so, if you're using a spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel),
        export the spreadsheet to CSV (comma separated values) and then upload the exported file.
        Supplying an end date is optional - the system will make an educated guess if unspecified.
