    %dt How are new rating lists created?
    %dd
      The system will create one automatically when it's time. The first
      time each month when this page is viewed, the
      rating list for that month will be created. Initially it will have
      default values for the tournament and payment cut-off dates which
      the rating officer may choose to adjust (within limits) before
      actually publishing the list.
    %dt When a new list is automatically created, is it also published?
    %dd
      No, initially no new published ratings will be created. The rating
      officer must hit the "Publish" button to actually publish the list
      and create new published ratings. This preserves the option to
      adjust the cut-off dates prior to publication.
