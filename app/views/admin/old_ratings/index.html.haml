    %dt What is meant by "old ratings"?
    %dd
      These are inherited from the last rating list produced by the old rating
      system (in September 2011) just before it was replaced by the current system.
    %dt Why are some full ratings associated with less than 20 games?
    %dd
      The old rating system created new ICU players using FIDE ratings (or
      equivalent) for the opponents of Irish players in foreign tournaments
      (such as Olympiads, IM tournaments and junior internationals). This
      led to the creation of thousands of ICU players with a small number of
      rated games (often just one) but with full ratings. In addition, some
      game counts inherited from the old system were underestimates because
      they did not include games played before the old system was established.
