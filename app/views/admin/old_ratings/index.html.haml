    %dt What is meant by "legacy ratings"?
    %dd
      Most of these ratings were inherited by the current ICU rating system (this web application)
      from the previous system (which was based on a Microsoft Access database) in September 2011.
    %dt Apart from the inherited ratings, are there any others that appear here?
    %dd
      There are occasionally additions to this list by the ratings of two groups of players:
      (1) players who have been resurrected from the archive (see
      = succeed(")") do
        = link_to "Former ICU Players", admin_old_players_path
      and (2) players who have an established FIDE rating at the time they join the ICU (usually foreigners).
      In the first case the ratings are lagacy (old) ratings, but belong to players who have been inactive
      and in the second case the (FIDE) ratings aren't legacy ratings but treating them as such is a
      convenient mechanism to provide players with realistic start ratings.
    %dt Why are some full ratings associated with less than 20 games?
    %dd
      The old rating system had to create new ICU players with full ratings
      for the FIDE-rated opponents of Irish players in foreign tournaments
      such as Olympiads, IM tournaments and junior internationals. This led
      to the creation of thousands of player records with a small number of
      rated games (often just one) but with full ratings. In addition, some
      game counts inherited from the old system were underestimates because
      they did not include games played before the old system was established.
