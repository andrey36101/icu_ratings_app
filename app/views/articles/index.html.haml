      %dt Can I create articles?
      %dd
        Yes. Hover your mouse over the
        %em Article
        menu item under
        %em Home
        and then click the
        = link_to "New", new_article_path
        button that appears.
      %dt Can I edit or delete an article?
      %dd
        Yes, but only if you own it (normally this means if you created it).
        Just click the article title to view it and if you are able to edit or
        delete it there will be appropriate buttons just below the article.
      %dt What different states apply to articles?
      %dd
        %p
          = icon_tag "published", "published"
          The article is published and is visible to members.
        %p
          = icon_tag "unpublished", "unpublished"
          The article is still in draft form and is not accessible by members.
      %dt What is an article's "identity"?
      %dd
        It's used to find the article programmatically, for example in order to place a link to the article in some help text.
        This gives more freedom for authors to update the article's title (which could have been used instead of identity)
        without worrying about breaking links elsewhere. Naturally, you shouldn't change an article's identity without good
        reason as otherwise helpful links somewhere on the site would suddenly disappear. An article only needs an identity if
        there are any programmatically generated links to it elsewhere on the site. The primary article key (<em>id</em>) does
        not function well for this purpose because it differs between the development, test and production versions of the site.
