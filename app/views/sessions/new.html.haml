    %dt What email and password should I use to log in?
    %dd
      If you're a current ICU member and have previously
      = link_to_icu "signed up", "sign_up"
      for a login account on the main
      = link_to_icu "ICU site"
      then you can use the same account to log in to this site.
    %dt What should I do if I've forgotten my password?
    %dd
      Click on the
      = link_to_icu "Forgot password?", "password/new"
      link, and you will go to the main ICU website.
      There you can enter your email that you use to login normally. You will receive an
      email with a link, that allows you to set a new password.
      If you have a new email address you could, as an alternative to reseting your old password, just
      = link_to_icu "sign up", "sign_up"
      for a new login account. See
      = link_to_icu "these instructions", "help/membership"
      for more help.
    %dt What does "your account has not yet been activated" mean?
    %dd
      %p
        When you
        = link_to_icu "signed up", "sign_up"
        for an ICU login account we sent you a confirmation email with a link. Your account
        would have been activated if you had received this message and clicked the link.
      %p
        If you don't have a record of this message (even in your spam folder) then please contact the
        = mail_to_icu(:webmaster)
        using the same email address as the one you chose for your login account and stating your season ticket.
    %dt If I don't yet have an account, how can I get one?
    %dd
      %p
        First,
        = link_to_icu "subscribe", "shop"
        as a member of the ICU for the current season, if you haven't already done so.
        Then
        = link_to_icu "sign up for an account", "sign_up"
        and wait for it to sync with this site (it can take up to 24 hours).
      %p
        On the main site, there are
        = link_to_icu "detailed instructions", "help/membership"
        for becoming a member and setting up an account, if you need further help.
    %dt Do I need anything special to submit tournament reports?
    %dd
      Yes. Please request the
      = mail_to_icu
      to authorise your account.
