    %dt What tournaments are displayed here?
    %dd Tournaments whose reports have no issues and that have been rated or are ready for rating.
    %dt A tournament I played in recently is not listed. Why not?
    %dd
      The rating report for the tournament might not have be received yet,
      or it might have been received but have issues preventing the
      tournament being rated. Reporters are encouraged to submit as soon
      as possible after the tournament has finished but if a couple of weeks
      have gone by without the tournament appearing here, you may wish to
      contact the tournament organisers or the
      = mail_to_icu :ratings
      to find out what's happening.
    %dt How is a tournament's stage (rated, queued, ready) shown?
    %dd
      With a flag to the left of the table. If the tournament is rated
      (the most common stage) the flag is omitted, otherwise it will be either
      - ["ready", "queued"].each_with_index do |stage, i|
        = icon_tag stage, t(stage), class: "inline"
        = "(#{t(stage, scope: :desc)})"
        = "or" if i == 0
    %dt Are all FIDE-rated tournaments marked as such?
    %dd
      Usually, only tournaments that are submitted to FIDE by the ICU are marked as FIDE-rated and
      show a link to the tournament on FIDE's site when displayed. However, on request, the rating
      officer will add links for other FIDE-rated tournaments. It would be appreciated if the FIDE
      tournament ID could be provided along with such requests.
